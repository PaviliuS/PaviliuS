### Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I am  **Pavel** â€“ Frontend developer from Moscow, specializing in creating high-quality applications.

### About me
I am a&nbsp;qualified Frontend developer with&nbsp;huge work experience
        and a&nbsp;good understanding of&nbsp;modern web-technologies. During
        my&nbsp;working time in&nbsp;the&nbsp;IT industry,
        I&nbsp;have&nbsp;developed many successful projects with&nbsp;usability,
        high performance and&nbsp;beautiful design.

   My&nbsp;professional career began with&nbsp;studying
        the&nbsp;fundamentals of&nbsp;information technology
        at&nbsp;the&nbsp;university, and&nbsp;since then I&nbsp;have&nbsp;been
        constantly improving my&nbsp;skills by&nbsp;learning and&nbsp;creating
        new, unique systems.

   In&nbsp;my&nbsp;work, I&nbsp;try to&nbsp;follow the&nbsp;principles
        of&nbsp;clean code and&nbsp;modular architecture, which allows
        me&nbsp;to&nbsp;create high-quality and&nbsp;reliable applications.

 Every new project gives me&nbsp;the&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;create
        something unique and&nbsp;really useful. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;proud that
        my&nbsp;applications not&nbsp;only meet technical requirements,
        but&nbsp;also bring real benefits to&nbsp;people.
