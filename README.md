### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Pavel**. I'm a Frontend developer and I have been working in this field for over year. In my work I use the `React & Redux` technology stack and related libraries, good knowledge of native `JavaScript & TypeScript` and the latest ES features. I also study and I'm engaged in constant self-education.
